# Python Practice 🚀🐍

This repository contains my small Python practice scripts as I learn and improve my programming skills.  
Each script is focused on a specific concept such as loops, conditionals, functions, and more.  

## 🎯 Purpose
- To track my learning journey in Python.  
- To practice writing clean and working code.  
- To build a foundation for larger projects in the future.  

## 🛠️ Topics Covered
- Variables & Data Types  
- Conditionals (if/else)  
- Loops (for, while)  
- Functions  
- File Handling  
- Basic Problem Solving  

## ✅ Example
**savings_goal.py**  
A small script that uses a `while` loop to help save money until a goal is reached.  

```python
goal_saving = 5000
month = 1
saving = 0

while saving < goal_saving:
    monthly_saving = int(input(f"Month {month} saving: "))
    saving += monthly_saving
    month += 1

print(f"Goal reached! Total savings: ${saving}")
```

## 🌱 Next Steps
I will keep adding more scripts as I continue learning.  
Stay tuned for projects that bring these concepts together!
